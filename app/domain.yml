  utter_organizations:
  - text: "The following businesses should be registered on FoodWatch.
  All food establishments including food trucks, and kiosks*
  Pest management companies
  Food safety training centers
  Food safety certification bodies
  Grease trap cleaning companies
  Water tank cleaning companies
  Food transportation vehicle suppliers
  Manpower (food handlers) suppliers to food establishments
  Vehicle Approval centers
  Food Packaging Material Supplier
  Every business registered in FoodWatch is called an 'entity.' An entity requires a specific location and a
  Primary PIC who can manage the data.
  *In the case of catering companies that operate in multiple sites under the same license, all sites should
  be registered as 'sub entities' under the main license entity."

  utter_hotel:
  - text: "The hotel should register first using the license number as a 'main entity' and the restaurants in the hotel
  should be registered as 'sub-entities'.
  Contact the FoodWatch support team for registering and mapping the entities and sub-entities.
  If there are restaurants with independent licenses that are leased out, the restaurant must be registered as a 
  separate entity and not as a sub-entity."

  utter_license:
  - text: "The caterer must register the main entity under the license and then create sub-entities for all the 
  individual sites. The caterer must designate PICs in each site to carry out the opening checks, delivery checks when 
  ready-to-eat food is delivered on-site, and process and equipment checks. Sites that are not active must be 
  deactivated immediately."

  utter_Primary_PIC:
  - text: "Every food business must have a Primary PIC registered and linked to the entity. The primary PIC will be
  able to use the various functionalities of the FoodWatch platform including food safety checks, adding the data of 
  food handlers, requesting training, adding suppliers, and managing all the relevant data essential for food safety 
  management."

  utter_Secondary_PIC:
  - text: "The business can also designate one or more secondary PICs who can perform food safety checks. The
  secondary PIC has limited access to other functionalities."

  utter_permits:
  - text: "Primary PICs and Technical experts can apply for new food-related permits through the FoodWatch web portal.
  In FoodWatch, open the ‘Smart Services’ tab to apply for the permits. All requirements relevant to the permit will be 
  shown when the permit request is opened. Ensure that the requirements are met before the permit is applied.
  Renewals of food permits can be done by FoodWatch Portal. However, renewals can be done only if there are no changes 
  in the information provided at the time of obtaining the first permit."

  utter_PICs_trained_certified:
  - text: "All secondary PICs must be formally trained and certified as a Food Safety Person in Charge in Dubai. The
  PIC must complete the training relevant to the type of food business, and obtain the certification after
  formal training and assessment.
  Primary PICs in a food establishment can be the owner or the manager of the food business. It is not
  mandatory for the Primary PICs to have formal training if they are not involved in conducting the food
  safety checks. However, there should be at least one other PIC in such an establishment with an 'Active'
  status to ensure that food safety requirements of Dubai Municipality are met."

  utter_obtaining_PIC_certification:
  - text: "Dubai’s digital strategy requires individuals in the city to be digitally empowered with knowledge on how
  to use and utilize the systems relevant to them. PIC training is a qualification linked to the food safety
  competency of the person and digital literacy is one of the core competencies required. Conducting the
  PIC checks before the training not only provides the PICs with a background on what checks are relevant
  to food safety, but also enables them to understand the concepts during the training better.
  People who have no role in food safety management should not be a part of the FoodWatch system as it
  dilutes the principles of leadership and management in food safety. Efforts must be taken to ensure that
  PIC certification is not seen as a normal ‘training’ program. Instead, PICs must be a recognized
  component of the food system with the primary role to ensure food safety in a business."

  utter_Active_status:
  - text: "Active status indicates that the PIC is actively conducting food safety checks in the food business.
  FoodWatch platform evaluates the performance of the PIC based on the checks conducted during a
  week (Monday to Sunday)."

  utter_Inactive:
  - text: "The status will not affect any of the features."

  utter_Inactive_performed:
  - text: "The score on the PICs profile indicates the score from the week before. The score will be updated once
  the PIC completes 7 days of checks."

  utter_Start-up:
  - text: "The start-up or opening check must be conducted at the beginning of every shift. Before the food
  handler starts the work, the PIC has to ensure that
  the staff are hygienic and free from any illness and injury
  ensure that the premises and equipment and clean and ready for food preparation
  ensure handwash facilities are ready
  ensure that any pest incident is reported to the pest contract company immediately
  ensure that food storage and transportation equipment are good
  conduct any other checks relevant to food safety"

  utter_food_handler:
  - text: "If the PIC notices a food handler with illness, the illness must be reported by selecting the name of the
  food handler from the drop-down list on the relevant inspection checkpoint. The PIC can designate
  another team member to take an action to exclude the employee or designate the action himself or
  herself.
  Once the incident is designated to a PIC, the task will appear on 'Action' in the app and 'bell icon' or
  'pending action' list in the web portal. The designated PIC has to close the incident reported to them by
  entering the action taken in the remarks column."

  utter_PIC_premises:
  - text: "The PIC must ensure that the relevant area or equipment is selected and reported. Along with the
  reporting, the work should be assigned to the designated team member (from the dropdown list that
  appears when the issue is reported.
  Once the incident is designated to a PIC, the task will appear on 'Action' in the app and 'bell icon' or
  'pending action' list in the web portal. The designated PIC has to close the incident reported to them by
  entering the action taken in the remarks column. The bell icon disappears once the action is taken.
  How should the PIC conduct process checks?
  Process check functionality on FoodWatch is designed to identify problems in processes, particularly the
  ones that are critical to food safety.
  A food business must record at least 4 process checks in a day and additional checks can be made if
  necessary.
  How should the PIC conduct equipment checks?
  The PIC should verify the status of the equipment while it is in use. This is to ensure that the food is safe.
  The checks related to equipment can include cleaning, functionality, ability to hold food at a specific
  temperature, or the ability to cool foods.
  Cleaning checks must be conducted before the use, or during the use if the use is prolonged."


  utter_process_equipment_check:
  - text: "Process checks help the PIC to identify any problems in the process steps. If a deviation is noticed, the
  next action would be to verify whether the equipment linked to that process is working properly.
  For example, if the cold food in the buffet is found to be at 15 Deg C after an hour on the display, the PIC
  must check the equipment used for holding the cold food. If the equipment is faulty, the equipment
  status should be reported using the app."





  utter_several_food_temperature:
  - text: "Food temperature checks can be done as many times as possible. However, considering the time and
  effort required to enter the data, only 4 or 5 records need to be made per day on FoodWatch. This
  should ideally be a mix of processes, particularly the ones involving high risk foods.
  All deviations must be reported. Any deviation in the system must be reported on FoodWatch. For
  instance, if you find the temperature of hot food in the buffet at 55 Deg C, this is a deviation and thus
  must be reported.
  Note that it is not about the quantity of data, but the quality. Regular checks are important to ensure
  that your processes are carried out in a way that food safety outcomes are achieved. Any deviations
  must be reported so that immediate action (correction) can be taken such a removal of food from the
  buffet when there is a temperature abuse, and corrective action can be taken by fixing the equipment
  before its used again. Looking at the long time performance of the equipment, the business can take
  preventive actions such a replacing the faulty equipment with the one that has a better performance."

  utter_supplier_management:
  - text: "Food safety in your business starts with the raw materials and services provided by your suppliers. For
  this reason, verification of the suppliers is an essential step before you obtain foods and services from
  them. By adding the supplier to your list on FoodWatch helps you to see their food inspection grade,
  and performance. This gives you an insight about the suppliers overall food safety performance."

  utter_PIC_report_pest_incidents:
  - text: "Dubai Municipality requires all food businesses to establish digital contracts with the pest management
  company using the FoodWatch Supplier Management system. You can add suppliers in a matter of
  seconds once you are in the supplier management portal.
  Once your contractor is added, all notifications regarding the pests will be directed to your supplier
  replacing the need to maintain records and calls."

  utter_PIC_contracts:
  - text: "Add the grease trap or water tank cleaning company as a supplier first. Once added, a PIC can use the
  FoodWatch connect app to request for any service through the ‘Manage Services’ tab.
  Do not maintain paper based records for grease traps. The history of cleaning can be viewed on
  FoodWatch platform.
  In the similar way, water tank cleaning requests can be made online using the app or the web portal."
